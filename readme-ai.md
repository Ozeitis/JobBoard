Each of these directories contains `route.ts` files, suggesting they handle specific HTTP routes related to their respective domains. For example:-`auth` likely manages authentication and user-related actions.-`companies` might handle information related to companies on the platform.-`jobs` could be responsible for posting and retrieving job listings.-`trigger` might deal with backend processes that need to be run on certain events.2. **Prisma IntegrationThe existence of a `prisma` directory with a `schema.prisma` file indicates the use of Prisma ORM for data management. This setup is crucial for handling database schema and interactions efficiently in a robust, type-safe manner.3. **Static and Public ResourcesLocated in the `public` directory, resources like logos and placeholder images suggest a user interface that might include company branding and user profile capabilities.4. **Configuration and Dependency Management-`package.json` and `bun.lockb` files indicate dependency management, with the latter suggesting the use of Bun |
